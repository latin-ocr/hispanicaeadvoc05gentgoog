to it, but that the case ol a person being conducted through a
church stands on a different basis. Ι assert, however, that it
is not the mere flight to the church, as a place oi refuge, but
our reverence lor the sanctity oi the church which brings
saiety. ,

In a question involving the immunity of a church, we
should follow canon law, and canon law makes no distinction
between the case of the man who flees to a church and that
oi him who is being conducted through a church, and this

were intercepted beyond these boundaries. But a treaty ol
peace between the British and Spanish Kings requires each
to protect subjecte of the other anywhere within his territories,
and the edict must be interpreted in the light ol the treaty
which is a contract. Otherwise a wrong would be done one

merely fixed in permanent form boundaries which had long
been recognized by usage. The King took no account of
usage in making the treaty. Probably he ,did not know ol it,
and most certainly the Spanish King did not. Further the

captor was really committing piracy under letters oi marque,
and not carrying on war. This predatory warfare is waged
