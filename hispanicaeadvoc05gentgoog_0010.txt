PREFACE

The republication of the classic works connected with the
history and development of international law was undertaken ,
by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1906, at the sug·

gestion of the undersigned, then Solicitor for the Department
of State, under whose supervision as General Editor the series
has since been published. On January 1, 19'17, the project
“ was transferred to the Carnegie Endowment for International
Pence and· the publication of the series is being continued by the

' Endowment’s Division 0f Inte-mationa} Law.

The present volume, Gentili’s Hispanico Advocatio, is edited
with 111 Introduction by the distinguished classicist, Professor
Frank F rost Abbott, who has also made the English translation
011110 text of Gentili’s treatise.

The reasons for including Gentili’s treatise 110 sufficiently
set forth b ‘Professor Abbott in his introduction. The original
111111111111111111111111111111111111111
was made, no copy was to be had in London, Paris or Leipzig.
The photographic reproduction made from a copy 01 the second
edition, appearing in 1661, in the possession 01 the Library 01
Congress, places the work within the hands 01 any and all coun-
tries, and Professor Abbott’s faithful translation of a text which
abounds in difficulties and which has not hitherto been translated
into English makes its mastery 111 easy matter to the English-
speaking world.

One reason for republishing the classics of International
Law 11 the difficulty of procuring the texts in convenient form
for scientific study3 the libraries in the United States have been
searched with the result that few of the earlier works were

· to be found. Another reason is that some of the works selected

for republication have never been translated into English. The
American publicist is therefore ata disadvantage in consult·
ing works of admitted authority, and when found they are, as
it were, scaled books to all but trained Latinists. The specialist
is thus forced ro rely upon summary statements and references
10 them to be found 111 treatises on Intemational LaW‚ or is
driven to examine them in European libraries, often a difficult
task, while the general reader is practically barred from the
stores of knowledge lockcd up in the earlier works on the Law
01 Ν111001. The same difficulty exists in Latin America, Japan,
and in a lesser degree in many European countries.
