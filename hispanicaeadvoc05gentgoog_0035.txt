30a Introduction
Ἃ

The Spaniards ask to be pennitted to cross to Belgium,
whither they had set out, under a royal sale conduct. It would
not be real redress to them, and it would not be a penalty to
the Dutch, ior the offense which they have committed against
England’s sovereignty, to send these Spaniards back to Spain,
because this disposition oi the case is exactly what would
please the Dutch. It may be urged that the King oi France

not parallel, however. The Spanish do not seem to have

the fiscus. The right of the fiscus to sell such property is open
to question, and the bad laith oi the merchants is proved by
their effacement of the marks ol the original owners

There is no redress to be had from Barbary, and ir the
procedure there is recognized as legal, the pirates will have
a convenient place, close to the Spanish lines oi trade, to

dispose oi their booty.

CHAPTER xvh-of the edict of the Kinq, binding those unoware of it.

England and Spain had made a treaty and under a royal
edict all hostile actions against Spaniards alter April 24 were
forbidden. An English privateer made a capture on the high
scas aiter the date mentioned. Shall the English be required
to restore the property captured? It may be premised that the
