place to another.

CHAPTER V.-Whether it is lawfnl to capture the enemy in the
territory of another.

One may pursue a wild beast into a neighbor’s field or a
fugitive irom justice into another's territory, and one may hold
with the ancients that “war is a hunt,” and with the doctors
that “a territory is nothing else than a domain,'’ drawing the
conclusion therefrom that a public enemy may be captured
in another's territory. But this conclusion is false. “The
territory of another insures safety, and, when territory changes,
control changes.” Itis commonly held that when a fugitive
flees into a church, he is sale. This privilege is opposed to
the public interest and to the theory oi the common law, but
it the doctrine holds in the case of a church, it is still more
applicable when there is a complete change oi territory. If it
holds lor a fugitive from justice, it should surely hold under
the laws of war. But what shall we say to the principle ot law
which Ι have laid down in my books On the Low of Wor
that “ anybody and everybody is bound to hand over to the
victor the property and the person oi the vanquished?'' Ι
reply that “this doctrine may be affirmed in the case ol a
complete victory, not in the case ol a small success.’' “It may
not be lawlul perse ior the victor to take the spoils, and he
who rules a territory may not always be required to turn them

κ over to the victor.’'

CHAPTER V1.-W hother it is lowiul to conduct an enemy captive
through onothests territory.

“The Spanish Ambassador opposes the action oi the Dutch
in taking property captured from their Spanish enemies . . .
through the British sea and along these shores, and he asks the
magistrate here that all the property be stopped and be re·
leased.” Various arguments may be urged in opposition to this
request. For instance, it is lawiul to transport grain through
a place from which it is unlawful to export it. Some doctors

also hold that it a criminal is being conducted through the
graveyard of a church, or even through territory under another
