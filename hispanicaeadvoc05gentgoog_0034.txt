enemy, this would be the case, but it is not true ol property
bought from pirates.

CHAPTER §llll-Arentes sold in Brazil in violationi of thr lato are
souqht in Enqland by tlte Spanish fiscus.

“A sale was made to Dutch enemies and to other aliens in
contravention oi the laws ol the Portuguese kingdom, which
forbids commerce there with those who are not Portuguese.‘’
Therelore its confiscation by the Spanish fiscus automatically
followed, inasmuch as the illicit sale was made by Spaniards.
This property, which is now in England, Spain asks to have
turned over to her. Personal property is under the control ol
the judge who confiscates it, even il it be outside ol his territory.
Ownership was not transferred to the buyers, because the law
forbids commercial transactions ol this sort. Consequently
also, the purchaser loses the purchase money.

The Dutch buyers can not claim to hold it, on the ground
that they have acquired it from their Spanish enemies‚ until
they have brought it within their lortified lines. But the
property is in England. It may be urged that ‘⁴ it is not lawlul
to summon to court a foreigner passing through the country
with any property,'nor to have any property taken from him.”
This principle does not apply it the judge who has jurisdiction
over the fugitive, in this case the King ol Spain, brings the suit.

CHAPTER XIV.-Whethcr the Kinq moy riqhtfully decide thot Span-
¹iards who bave been routhy handled by the Dutch off a
port of tlte Kinq moy soil in salety to Belgium.

Spaniards were attached by the Dutch off an English harbor
and are now blockaded in the harbor. Itis not lawlul to
commit such acts in foreign territory. The heat ol battle and
the plea that the Dutch did not recognize the fact that they
were in English territorial waters can not excuse them. “The
blockaded man is a man held captive,” and ‚the doctors teach,
and usage shows, that, “lione hasbeen captured in a place
where he ought not to have been captured, he should even
be allowed to make his ways to a place ol security with such
saleguards that pursuit would be difficult.”
