tions. Thus, in writing to the junior counsel in one oi the cases
in which they both appeared, he says:

Your arguments were outside the present inquiry. Most learned man, always
remember to notice the lorm which the question takes, although you can include,
and perhaps also at times ought to include, what either may not be pertinent

to the matter, or may be ol no weight. By such things some judges are olten
more influenced than they are by appropriate and sound considerations.²⁰

In another personal letter he says ol a judge before whom he
had recently appeared:

At eight o’clock in the evening he was asked by me to examine all the points,
at sunrise the next morning he gave a judgment against us; and on another
occasion aiter hearing the representatione oi six advocates on the other side up
to the hour lor dinner, right alter dinner he gave an interlocutory decree, with·

Cravetta (this 1 know lor sure), on which our strongest argument was based.²'

In presenting his arguments Gentili shows a thorough ac·
quaintance with the facts in the case and with the principles
which underlie it. He has a logical mind and his method of
argumentation is keen. Sometimes, indeed, his shrewdness is
carried so lar that his reasoning lacks the note ol sincerity. In
attempting an appreciation ol the literary torm oi his pleas,
it is only fair to bear in mind two consideratione He was ad·
dressing a seventeenth not a twentieth century court, and he
did not see this book through the press. Gentili was a very
learned man, and not only the weight but the actual number oi
authorities which an advocate cited counted heavily in the mind
ol a judge. It was natural, therefore, ior Gentili, out of his wide
reading, to multiply references to earlier jurists. It is not im·
possible too that he may have felt a pride in doing so, but this
display oi learning is somewhat tedious to the present-day reader,
and interferes with the continuity ol the argument. He errs also
on the side of completeness by arraying too many arguments in
support oi his cause. Some ol them will not bear close examina-
tion, and a elever opponent would have been able to make a
specious case against him by directing the attention ot the court
to arguments oi this sort. Here again he is merely following
contemporary practice in bringing in every consideration which
