has a bearing on the question at issue, and he should be judged
by the usage oi his own time.

It was unfortunate that the Advocatio was not published in
Gentili’s own liletime. Had it been, he would probably have
improved its lorm at many points. His brother doubtless
brought it out exactly as it stood in the manuscript. Many of
his sentences are obscure, awkwardly expressed and involved,
and not infrequently we find memoranda rather than lully ex·
panded arguments. These characteristics make certain nas·
sages very hard to understand. Gentili had a reasonablv clear
style, as one can see in his treatises Oa Embassies and Oa tle
Loro of War and probably the formos this book would have
been much improved, it the author had had an opportunity to
revise rt.

The attitude which Gentili took toward the different branches
ol law and the method which he followed in establishing judicial
principles are more clearly shown in the Advocatio than in any
ol his other writings, and perhaps in that lact the primary im·
portance ot this work lies. In the first place he broke away from
ecclesiastical tradition. Most ol his predecessors, men like
Covarruvias, Suarez, Molina and Soto, who were Catholic theo·
logians, carried over into theirdiscussions of international law the
principles ol the canon law and the method of a priori reasoning.
Gentili was a jurist by profession3 his adherence to Protestantism
released him from ecclesiastical preconceptions, and the bent oi
his own mind seems to have led him to the practice ol examining
concrete cases ol his own time and of drawing practical rules
from them. He may therefore with propriety be called the
founder of the modern historical school of intemational law. It
is characteristic of this change ol attitude in the study oi the
Law of N ations that probably not one in fifty ol his own rel·
erences in the Advocatio is to the canon law, and when the us·
ages ol the Law oi Nations and the teachings oi the canon law

come into conflict, as they do in the discussion given above ol .
