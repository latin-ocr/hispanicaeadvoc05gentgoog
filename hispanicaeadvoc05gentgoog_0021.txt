16a 2 Introduction

comparable to a home.'‘ ²² In general he regards the right ol
search at sea as of doubtful validity, and only to be exercised
off the coasts ol the prince who owns the warship claiming it.¹³
Another interesting point is raised by the plight ol some English·
men who have been recruited in a neutral country, England, lor
service under the Spanish flag, and captured, while on their
way to join the Spanish forces, by the Dutch. A maritime ques·
tion somewhat analogous to this is whether‘a vessel is piratical
which is manned by neutrals but is under the command ol a
' citizen of one of two belligerent Powers.¹⁴

One ol the cases which he pleads has a double interest lor
us, because it illustratos his method of argumentation and con·
cerns a subject which is much discussed at the present time. In
a passage in one of his speeches he tells us that before appearing
in court it was his practice to turn over in his mind everything
which could be said in support oi his opponente. Indeed the
early part ol most oi his arguments consists of a categorical state-
ment οἱ the case ol the opposite side, supported by the laws and
text-writers who could be cited in its defense. In illustration of
this characteristic scholastic method, and because ol the present·
day interest ol the issue involved in the suit in question it may be
worth while to give an abstractos his argument.

An English ship while en route to Constantinople with a
cargo of general merchandise and powder, “pulvis tormento·
rias,’' as Gentili calls it, was seized by the Sardiniam and Maltese

and the cargo confiscarent Gentili appeared forthe English
owners to contest the right ol confiscation. Let us present his
conclusions in the same systematic way in which he sets th'em
forth in his plea in court. At the outset come the arguments,
marshalled firstly, secondly, and so forth, from the standpoint
of the Sardinians and Maltese: (ι) The civil law, as it stands in
the Code of Justinian, prescribes capital punishment for any·
one who shall furnish the barbarians with munitions of war.
(2) The canon law imposes excommunication upon Christians
’ who send arms to the saracene, and the Saracens are amalga-
