aoo Introduction

world constituted a single State, and Roman law was drawn up
ior the citizens oi this one State. But in the modern world there
are many independent sovereignties, and the Law oi Nations
covers questions at issue between the citizens oi these different
States. To this purpose the civil law, in view oi the circum-
stances in which it grew up, is not adapted. The civil law,
commentatore on it and precedents from antiquity are frequently
cited, but rather by way oi confirming or illustrating rules de·
rived from contemporary usage. At the same time Gentili stands ’
between the ancient and the modern world, and his inheritance
from the ancient world is evident in many ways. It comes out
in the scholastic form oi his argumentation, which carries us

back to the schools oi the Middle Ages. It appears occa· ‘

sionally in a casuistical argument, as it does in the iancilul
distinction which he tries to make in one passage ²⁹ between
the meanings oi certain words, or in the insistence in another
connection on an exact analogy between physical and legal
processes.²⁰

Great as were his achievements in the field of international
law, yet in stemming the tide in England which was setting to-

earnestly in this cause, but it was a lost cause, as he himself seems
to recognize at the close oi one ol his speeches recorded in the
Advocatio:

Granted that these pettiioggers oi the common law have pushed their way
into marriage cases, into testamentary, ecclesiastical and maritime cases, and
into others oi this sort, which still have always been held to be the peculiar
pmvince oi those versed in the civil law, but granted that they have pushed
their way in, simply because those cases had to do with Englishmen, with English
concems, with transactions carried on in England; on this account, pray, shall
they rush in and seize these cases involving foreigners? Even though this state
oi affairs is in part to be explained by the daily increasing power oi those who
study the common law, still the old landmarks should be preserved.²¹

Inone ol the two taslrs then to which he devoted himself,
he in part failed, I mean in maintaining the supremacy oi the
civil law over the common law in regulating those transactions
in which the civil law seemed to him especially applicable. In
the other he succeeded, for he set forth once lor all in his
