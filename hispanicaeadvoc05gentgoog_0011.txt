ba Presace

Eminent publicists, European and American, who have
been consulted as to the uselulness oi the plan to republish
the Classica, have indorsed the project and have pledged their
personal cooperation. The works to be included in the series
have not only been approved but suggested by them, so that
the undertaking is international in scope, in selection, and in
execution.

The underlying principle oi selection hasbeen to reissue
those works which can be said to have contributed either to the
origin or to the growth ol International Law and the term
classic has been used in the broad rather than in the narrow
sense, so that no work will be omitted which can be said to
have contributed to the origin or growth of the Law ol N a·
tions. The masterpieces of Grotius will naturally be the
central point in the series, but the works of his leading prede·
cessors and successore will likewise be included. The text of
each author will be reproduced photographically‚ so as to
lay the source beiore the reader without the mistakes which
creep into a newly printed text. In the case oi the early
authors the photographed text will be accompanied by a revised
text whenever that course shall seem desirable. An Introduc-
tion will be prefixed to each work, giving the necessary bio-
graphical details and stating the importance oi the text and its
place in International Law3 tables oi errata in the original will
be added, and notes deemed necessary to clear up doubts and
ambiguities or to correct mistakes in the text will be supplied.
Variations in successive editions oi the text published in the
author‘s liietime will be noted, but little or nothing in the
nature of historical commentary will be lurnished.

Each work will be accompanied by an English version made
expressly ior the series by a competent translator.

It is hoped that the series will enable specialists as well as
general readers to trace International Law from its faint and
unconscious beginnings to its present ample proportions and
to forecast with some degree oi certainty its future develop-
nssent intoi that law which Mirabeau tells us will one day rule
teworl .
