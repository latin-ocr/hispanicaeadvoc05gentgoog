it contains, addressed by the author to'the Spanish Ambassador
and to others on certain cases after the decision on them had
been rendered, give it a personal note which is lacking in other
legal works, and throw some light on contemporary conditions
and practices.

Having been disappointed in his purpose of publishing the

collection himself, Alberico instructed his brother, Scipione, to
edit it, and it appeared five years after his death. Scipione
appropriately dedicares the work to Don Baltasar de Zirniga, '
a kinsman of Don Pedro de Zdfiiga wh0, as Spanish Am·
bassador in England, had invited Alberico to act as the·advocate
of ‚Spain The cases involving the Law of Nations are collected
in the first book. The second book is of a more informal
character than the first one, and is devoted almost exclusively to
private law, and it is doubtful if many of the pleas which
it contains are in defense of Spanish clients.
’ The contents of the first book are varied. The presence in it
of one class of questions illustrates some of the important changes
which civilization has undergone since the sixteenth century.
The pirate, the privateer, the Berber and the Turk figure largely
in it. What constituted piracy? This was a delicate question
in the days of Sir Francis Drake and the “ Sea Beggars,'' and
the line between piracy and legal warfare was not an easy one ’
to draw. If one bought property ditectly from pirates, could
he acquire legal ownership of it? Gentili thought that he could
not, but if one bought through the fiscus of Barbary property
taken by pirates, the case was more difficult because of the
quasi-legal standing of Barbary among the States of the world.²
So far as the Turk was concerncd, ecclesiastical tradition and
canon law taught that there was a perpetual state of war be·
tween the believer and the infidel and that the Christian might
have no dealings with the infidel. Gentili boldly challenges
this doctrine in the name of the Law of Nations which, as he
says, makes no distinction between nations. He challenges it
in the name of England, because England has no perpetual
enemies.⁸ But he still retains a vestige of the old prejudice
against the Turks in holding that their testimony may not be
taken against Christians.⁴
