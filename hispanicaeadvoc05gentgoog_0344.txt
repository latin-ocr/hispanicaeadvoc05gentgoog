THE CLASSICS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW

This series, which includes the classic works connected with the history and develop-
ment οἱ international law, was undertaken by the Carnegie Institution oi Washington
‘in 19ο6, at the suggestion ol Mr. Jarnes Brown Scott, then Solicitor lor the Departrnent
oi State, under whose supervision as General Editor the series has since been published.
On January 1, 1917, the proiect was transferred ιο the Carnegie Bndowment lor Inter-
national Peace and the publication oi the series is being continued ογ the Endowrnent’s
Division oi international Law, oi which the General Editor of the Classica is the
Director.

The republication oi these classice has been undertaken principally on account oi
the difficulty oi procuring the texte in convenient form lor scientilic study. The text ol
each author is reproduced photographically, so as ιο lay the source before the reader
without the mistakes which creep into a newly printed text. An introduction is prefixed
to each worlr, giving the necessary biographical details concerning its author and stating
the importante oi the text and its place in internetional law. Tables oi errata in the
original are added when necessary, and notes to clear up doubts and ambiguities or to
correct mistakes in the text are supplied. Each ol the Classica is specially edited ογ an
expert in internetional law and is accompanied by an English version made expressly
lor the series ογ a competent translator.

The Iollowtng works have appeared and are now on sale. The price is indicated
ior each worlr. They can be obtained ογ remittance ιο the publishers, either the Claren-
don Press, Oxford, England, or the Oxiord University Press, American Branch, 33 West
