Τιιιι Ηιιιιιιιοιι Αιινοοιιιο.

There are two periods in the active lile ol Alberico Gen-
tili.² Twenty years of it he spent at Oxiord‚ teaching
civil law and writing on the Law ol Nations. The last
eight years ol it he passed mainly' ιιι London,1n the practice
of his profession. Within these eight years the Hispanico Ad·
vocatio falls. The book therefore represents Gentili's final
judgment οιι many weighty matters. It contains the applicatioo
to concrete cases of the legal principles which he had been
reaching for a score of years No other yurist ot his time has
left us this double record, of his theory oi the law and ol his
practice of ιι.

But ιι is not merely the theoretical and the practical methods
followed by Gentili io approaching legal questions which we
find illustrated io this twolold recordor his activity as a jurist.
The relation between the two parts is much more intimate. In
the greatest of his books, in his treatise On tle Low of W ar, he
had set down the principles which should govern the conduct
of war. In the Pleas os o Spanish Advocote he is concerned
with war again, but this time he is applying the principles which
he had laid down in the earlier work to the actual questions
arising out ot a great war oi his own time. During the last
part of the sixteenth century and the early days of the seventeenth,
Spain and the N etherlands were fighting each other. Out of
